# JavaLibs

Your goal is to create a program similar to a MadLib. Write a story where certain parts of the resulting story
text are modified by the user’s input. Prompt the user for various inputs like: noun, plural noun, name, adjective, adverb, etc...
Use Scanner to get input from the console.

When you output your story, make sure your all your text is visible at the same time. It’s not ok for text to be
too long for your computer screen or output window. Your story will need to be spread across several lines
instead of being printed in one giant line of output. This helps keep your output clean and your program more
user friendly.

It’s ok for your program to crash if the user inputs inappropriate data. In other words, It’s ok if your program
crashes because you’ve expected the user to input a number, when they’ve instead input a String. We’ll
cover exception handling later in the course.

### Grading Criteria:
- Create and use a Scanner object
- Accept at least 1 input, to be parsed as an int
- Accept at least 1 input, to be parsed as a double
- Use at least 1 input in a question for the user
- Do math with at least 1 int input
- Do math with at least 1 double input
- Accept at least 10 total inputs
- All variables named properly
- Code formatting (whitespace and indentation)
- Clean output using concateation

It’s ok for this problem to write your entire program within the main method.
